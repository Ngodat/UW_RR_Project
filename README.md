# Project title: Gender Stereotypes and Bias in Experimental Simulations of Employment Decision Making - reproducing the meta-analysis study
## Project idea
In this project, we replicate a meta-analysis regarding gender bias at work. The original meta-analysis examined the effects of decision-maker gender, amount and content of available information, type of evaluation, and motivation to make careful decisions on gender bias at work, using 136 studies. 

Due to the large number of studies used in the original analysis, the project would only apply same processing methods on 10 random studies from the original analysis. After that, we add 5 new studies into the list of studies to replicate results. Via the project output, we can test whether the conclusions from the original analysis hold for a sub dataset and hold over near future.

## The dataset
The original dataset includes 136 studies. Studies' results such as Rater Gender, Individuating Information, Type of Evaluation are coded based on the rule of the analysis. 

## Report structure
* 1. Back ground and hypotheses to test 
* 2. Reproduce the meta-analysis using a subset of data and 4 new datasets
* 3. Compare the results and conlusions

## Hypotheses
In this project, we test 2 hyotheses used the orginal analysis:
* Hypothesis 1. Gender-role congruity bias will be found, with men being rated more favorably than women for maledominated jobs and women being rated more favorably than men for female-dominated jobs.
* Hypothesis 2. Male raters will exhibit stronger gender-role congruity bias than female raters.
